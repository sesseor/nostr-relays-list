# nostr-relays-list
nostr relays list that is generated automatically.. future versions going to follow.. if you know of a relay that is sharing illegal contct plz let me know and i will remove it from the list 
in future version the first relays in the list are most likly to be most or recently active.. if you can only add a few then you should always grab the first ones in the list
